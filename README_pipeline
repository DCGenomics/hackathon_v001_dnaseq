This pipeline uses bpipe to control the running of the various pieces of the pipeline. Bpipe handles errors and allows restarting of failed analyses.

To use the pipeline, users must alter the DNAseq_hackathon.pipe file to reflect the following parameters:

SCRIPTS_DIR should be pointed to the path of the Python and PERL scripts used in this pipeline and 
REFERENCE_DIR should be pointed to the path of the reference files required by the tools in this pipeline.

If you want to run MuTect:

	Set MUTECT_FILE to the input GTF file
	Set MUTECT_OUTPUT to the desired output file

For running the CAKE pipeline:
	
	SAMPLEFILE is the input data in CSV format
	OUT_DIR is the directory for writing the output
	CAKE_DIR is the CAKE installation directory
	

For annotation with ANNOVAR:
	
	ANNOVAR_INPUT is an ANNOVAR formatted file to which line numbers must be appended
	ANNOVAR_FILE is the ANNOVAR formatted file for annotation with line numbers for the final concatenation step
	ANNOVAR_OUT is the final output file from ANNOVAR
	ANNOVAR_DIR is the location of the ANNOVAR installation

For the two VCF cross-comparison:
	VCF_1 and VCF_2 are the two VCF files for comparison


Users can decide which pieces of the pipeline to use  - modify the Bpipe.run at the end of the DNAseq_hackathon.pipe file. Each piece is executed sequentially in the order inputted.
